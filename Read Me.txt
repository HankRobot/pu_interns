Essentially, to get it to work, just follow the instruction to create your Azure server at 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-connect-query-python

Alternatively, just use my server. I've set up a disposable account for your convenience:
server = 'vainos-iot.database.windows.net'
database = 'VainOS_IoT'
username = 'vainos'
password = 'Asdf1234'

To use it, you will need to give me your Raspberry pi's public IP address 
(Just go to "find my IP" or something on RPi browser, if you are on SSH, then use ifconfig **IMPORTANT** Dont give me 192.168.x.x addresses, we both know that address is useless.)

Also, when running the Python Script, if it says pyodbc not found, just use "sudo pip install pyodbc". If you are testing it from a Windows PC, open Windows PowerShell and run "pip install pyodbc"

Anything just let me know.

Cheers!
